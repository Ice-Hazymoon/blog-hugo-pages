[["Annabel Lee","2022年02月02日","/en-us/2022/02/18/annabel-lee.html/"," Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849）  It was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know By the name of ANNABEL LEE; And this maiden she lived with no other thought Than to love and be loved by me. She was a child and I was a child, In this kingdom by the sea; But we loved with a love that was more than love I and my Annabel Lee; With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven coveted her and me. And this was the reason that, long ago, In this kingdom by the sea， A wind blew out of a cloud by night chilling my Annabel Lee; So that her highborn kingsman came And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulchre In this kingdom by the sea. The angels, not half so happy in the heaven, Went evnying her and me Yes! That was the reason(as all men know, in this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of the cloud, Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. But our love it was stronger by far than the love Of those who were older than we Of many far wiser than we And neither the angels in heaven above， Nor the demons down under the sea， Can ever dissever my soul from the soul Of the beautiful Annabel Lee. For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful Annalbel Lee; And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride, In the sepulchre there by the sea, In her tomb by the side of the sea.
